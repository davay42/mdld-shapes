# Target Class {=sh:targetClass .class:TargetingMechanism label}

> Targets all nodes that are instances of a specific RDF class (rdf:type) for shape validation. Essential for class-based validation scenarios across entire domains. {comment}

## Demo {=ex:demo ?cat:hasDemo}

This demo demonstrates class-based targeting using a product management scenario where all Product instances are validated for business requirements.

The **Product Validation Shape** {=ex:ProductValidationShape .sh:NodeShape ?cat:hasShape label} targets all [Product] {+ex:Product ?sh:targetClass} instances to validate core product requirements.

**Product Name Rule** {=ex:#productName .sh:PropertyShape ?sh:property} requires the [name] {+ex:name ?sh:path} property to have exactly [1] {sh:minCount sh:maxCount ^^xsd:integer} value: **Product must have exactly one name** {sh:message}

[The shape] {=ex:ProductValidationShape} also has **Product Price Rule** {=ex:#productPrice .sh:PropertyShape ?sh:property} that requires the [price] {+ex:price ?sh:path} property to be at least [0.01] {sh:minInclusive ^^xsd:decimal}: **Product price must be positive** {sh:message}

### 📋 Test Data {=ex:data .Container}

#### Laptop {=ex:Laptop .ex:Product}

A valid product with name and positive price.

Name: [MacBook Pro] {ex:name}
Price: [1299.99] {ex:price ^^xsd:decimal}

#### Invalid Product {=ex:InvalidProduct .ex:Product}

A product with missing name and negative price.

Price: [-50.00] {ex:price ^^xsd:decimal}

#### Service {=ex:Service .ex:Service}

A service that shouldn't be targeted by product validation.

Name: [Consulting] {ex:name}
Price: [200.00] {ex:price ^^xsd:decimal}

---

{=ex:demo} must produce exactly **2** {cat:expectsViolations ^^xsd:integer} violations.

### Expected Validation Results {=ex:results ?cat:hasResults}

1. **Laptop** - passes (has name and positive price)
2. **Invalid Product** - fails twice (missing name AND negative price)
3. **Service** - not validated (not a Product, so not targeted by class-based validation)

Note: Class-based targeting validates all instances of the specified class, making it ideal for domain-wide validation rules.

### 🔍 Test Validation

```bash
# This should show 2 violations - missing name and negative price
ig-cli validate ./targeting/targetClass.md
```

## 📝 MDLD Syntax Patterns

**Recommended pattern for class-based targeting:**

```md
# Target all instances of a class
{+ex:ClassName ?sh:targetClass}
```

**Use cases:**
- **Domain validation** - all Product instances must have required fields
- **Regulatory compliance** - all FinancialTransaction instances must follow rules
- **Data quality** - all UserAccount instances must have valid emails
- **Business rules** - all Order instances must have valid dates

**Key advantages:**
- ✅ **Scalable validation** - applies to all instances automatically
- ✅ **Domain-wide consistency** - ensures all entities follow same rules
- ✅ **Easy maintenance** - add/remove rules once, apply everywhere
- ✅ **Type safety** - only validates instances of specified type

### **E-commerce:**
```md
# All products must have prices and names
{+schema:Product ?sh:targetClass}
```

```md
# All patients must have medical records
{+medical:Patient ?sh:targetClass}
```

### **Finance:**
```md
# All transactions must be auditable
{+financial:Transaction ?sh:targetClass}
```

### **HR:**
```md
# All employees must have contracts
