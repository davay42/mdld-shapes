**Employee must have valid address** {=#addressRule .sh:PropertyShape sh:message} requires [address] {+ex:address ?sh:path} to conform to [Address Shape] {+ex:AddressShape ?sh:node}.

**Address Shape** {=ex:AddressShape .sh:NodeShape} requires [street] {+ex:street ?sh:path} to have at least [5] {sh:minLength ^^xsd:integer} characters.
